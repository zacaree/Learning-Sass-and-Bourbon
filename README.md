This project was created to help me continue learning Sass and to get my first experience using Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters.

Favorite features include:
   - A flexbox sidebar menu made without the use of javascript. Built using the on/off state of a checkbox.
   - The sidebar menu button that expands when you click is pretty fun too.
